# Approuter User API Service

The content in this branch accompanies the post [SAP Tech Bytes: Approuter User API Service](https://blogs.sap.com/2021/02/20/sap-tech-bytes-approuter-user-api-service/).

To try this out for yourself, once you have this branch of the repo locally, follow these steps.

**Authenticate with Cloud Foundry**

```shell
cf login
```

**Create the xsuaa service instance**

```shell
cf create-service xsuaa application xsuaa-application -c xs-security.json
```

**Create and deploy the app**

```shell
cf push -f manifest.yml
```

**Open the URL in your browser to see the data**

To see what the User API Service returns for you, look for the URL in the route information for your app (it will be randomly generated). It will look something like this (the value for `routes`):

```
Waiting for app to start...

name:                userapitest

isolation segment:   trial
routes:              userapitest-appreciative-bilby-wy.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com

buildpacks:          nodejs
```

Open that as a URL in your browser. You should information shown similar to what was described in the blog post.
